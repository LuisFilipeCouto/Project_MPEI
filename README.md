# Project_MPEI

### About the project
This project involves the development of an application that analyses and detects similarities between txt files by utilizing probabilistic approaches and data structures <br>
The [**main application**](DemonstracaoConjunta/Main.java) incorporates three key components:
  - [**Stochastic Counter**](Modulos/ContadorEstoc.java)
  - [**Counting Bloom Filter**](Modulos/CountingBloomFilter.java)
  - [**MinHash**](Modulos/MinHash.java)

The key components have been verified through module testing. These tests can be done by executing the corresponding [module test file](TestesModulos/)
